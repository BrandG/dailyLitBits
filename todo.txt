DailyLitBits Roadmap

- Webpage enhancements
	* Time Zone Adjustment: Allow people to change the hour that their e-mail comes to them. Also, allow them to change the timezone associated with them.

- Testing Framework
	* API Endpoint Test: User Signup (POST /signup)
	* API Endpoint Test: All Static Pages (/intro, /library, /privacy)
	* API Endpoint Test: Unsubscribe Flow (GET/POST /unsubscribe)
	* API Endpoint Test: Admin Page (GET /admin)
	* Unit Test: Text Cleaning (ingest.py::clean_text)
	* Unit Test: Metadata Extraction (ingest.py::extract_title, extract_author)
	* Unit Test: Security Token Logic (security.py)

- As you scale, if you haven't set up Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) records in your DNS (DigitalOcean/Namecheap) for SendGrid, Gmail/Yahoo will eventually start blocking your emails or sending them to Spam. Action: Verify these are green in your SendGrid dashboard. 

- Backup Restore Test: You have a script that makes backups. Have you ever tried to restore one? (A backup you haven't restored is just a file taking up space). 

- "Dead Letter" Monitoring: We need a way to see chunks that permanently failed the AI process (e.g., if the text was corrupt). A simple Admin Dashboard view for "Failed Chunks" would be smart. 

- What if someone wanted to read multiple books per day? Could we allow that? It would certainly be a premium service.

- Do we want to set up a testing framework? What would we test?

- Instead of a dropdown on the main page, we should find a way to use the library code. Perhaps we make it like an openable section on the main page that shows all the books as tiles.

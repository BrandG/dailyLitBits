DailyLitBits Roadmap

- Webpage enhancements
	* Time Zone Adjustment: Allow people to change the hour that their e-mail comes to them. Also, allow them to change the timezone associated with them.

- Testing Framework
	* [x] API Endpoint Test: User Signup (POST /signup)
	* [x] API Endpoint Test: All Static Pages (/intro, /library, /privacy)
	* [x] API Endpoint Test: Unsubscribe Flow (GET/POST /unsubscribe)
	* [x] API Endpoint Test: Admin Page (GET /admin)
	* [x] Unit Test: Text Cleaning (ingest.py::clean_text)
	* [x] Unit Test: Metadata Extraction (ingest.py::extract_title, extract_author)
	* [x] Unit Test: Security Token Logic (security.py)

- As you scale, if you haven't set up Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) records in your DNS (DigitalOcean/Namecheap) for SendGrid, Gmail/Yahoo will eventually start blocking your emails or sending them to Spam. Action: Verify these are green in your SendGrid dashboard. 

- Backup Restore Test: You have a script that makes backups. Have you ever tried to restore one? (A backup you haven't restored is just a file taking up space). 

- "Dead Letter" Monitoring: We need a way to see chunks that permanently failed the AI process (e.g., if the text was corrupt). A simple Admin Dashboard view for "Failed Chunks" would be smart. 

- What if someone wanted to read multiple books per day? Could we allow that? It would certainly be a premium service.

- Instead of a dropdown on the main page, we should find a way to use the library code. Perhaps we make it like an openable section on the main page that shows all the books as tiles.

- Instead of starting a user over at the beginning of a book every time they switch editions, find a way to get the current position (the last hundred characters of their most current chunk), find that same position in the new edition, and set the user's chunk position to that.
